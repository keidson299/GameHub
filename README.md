# GameHub

This is a React based website built using Vite that allows users to search for new games and filter them based on genre, name, price, and other filters.

## Getting Started

First clone the repo, then open it in your preferred IDE.

### Installing packages

Open a terminal and run

```
npm install
```

This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file and put them into a new node_modules folder

### Running Dev Instance

To test the page, open a terminal window and run

```
npm run dev
```

This will create a locally hosted instance of the website. The local address will be written to the console.
Take that address and plug it into your browser of choice to see and test the website

### Building the Site

To build the website, run the following command in the terminal

```
npm run build
```

If there are no errors in the code, then the built files will be but in a new dist folder, ready to deploy wherever you choose

## Deployed For You To See

A built version of the site has been deployed to github pages at https://keidson299.github.io/GameHub/
